3. Program Organization
So far, we’ve learned some Python basics and have written some short scripts. However, as you start to write larger programs, you’ll want to get organized. This section dives into greater details on writing functions, handling errors, and introduces modules. By the end you should be able to write programs that are subdivided into functions across multiple files. We’ll also give some useful code templates for writing more useful scripts.
