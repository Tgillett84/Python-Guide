7. Advanced Topics
In this section, we look at a small set of somewhat more advanced Python features that you might encounter in your day-to-day coding. Many of these topics could have been covered in earlier course sections, but weren’t in order to spare you further head-explosion at the time.

It should be emphasized that the topics in this section are only meant to serve as a very basic introduction to these ideas. You will need to seek more advanced material to fill out details.

7.1 Variable argument functions
7.2 Anonymous functions and lambda
7.3 Returning function and closures
7.4 Function decorators
7.5 Static and class methods
